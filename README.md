# Pick and Place XYZ - Factory-IO
Place boxes onto pallets using a three axes manipulator.

Once the scenario had been analyzed, a scene automation solution was developed using the ST language - structured text, from the IEC 61131-3 standard. 
Then, after recording the solution on the ESP32 microprocessor, the scene was communicated via Modbus Ethernet and once all the process variables had been identified, analyzed and configured in Factory IO, it was possible to control the scene via the microprocessor.
